Skyscanner (Work In Progress)

Skyscanner is a straightforward tool that's all about helping you figure out if today's sky is worth taking pictures of. As someone who does a lot of photography, I wanted to create a simple yet effective way to decide when to head outside with my camera. Using machine learning, this API takes a look at current sky conditions and tells you if it's a good time to snap some sky photos. No more guessworkâ€”just more great shots.
