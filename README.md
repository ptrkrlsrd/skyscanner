# Skyscanner (Work In Progress)

Skyscanner is a tool that's all about helping you figure out if today's sky is worth taking pictures of. As someone who does a lot of photography, I wanted to create a simple yet effective way to decide when to head outside with my camera. Using machine learning, this model takes a pictures taken from webcameras in Oslo as the input and look at current sky conditions to tell you if it's a good time to snap some sky photos. No more guessworkâ€”just more great shots.
